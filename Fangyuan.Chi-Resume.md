## Professional Experience

##### **Java Engineer @Yidai Media Corporation (Vancouver, Canada)  Jul. 2015-Feb. 2016**
Platforms that provide online-to-offline (O2O) shared economy services, which focus on local food searching and short/long distance trip, etc.; currently has over thousand cooperating restaurants, near hundred planned trip events, and a steady growing number of users.
    
* Worked (with a team of six developers/designers) mainly on developing the back-end of the platform; Worked on different APIs for components such as online payment (stripe), social network authentication (WeChat and Facebook), customized front-end calendar (JQuery UI), content indexing (Lucene), etc.; Implemented Restful APIs to support the in-house built IOS application 
* Worked closely with fellow developers, UI designers, and members in business department to discuss the design and features needed, as well as the development timeframe; Participated in end-to-end development process; 
                
*Used: AngularJS, Grails, Velocity, HTML5, Javascript, JQuery, Lucene, Spring MVC, Spring Security, MySQL, MVN and Gradle.* 


##### **Graduate Research Assistant @The University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada)   Sep. 2013-Nov. 2015**
Researched mainly on peer-assisted and component-based cloud gaming systems.
    
* Proposed a cooperative task allocation mechanism(distributed decision making process), which offloads computation tasks to devices in vicinity to optimize the overall system energy consumption, bandwidth consumption, and interactive latency; Implemented simulationbased experiments to support the proposed mechanism.
* Publications: 
    * 1) “Ad hoc cloudlet based cooperative cloud gaming,” accepted by Transaction on Cloud Computing (TCC); 
    * 2) “Ad hoc cloudlet based cooperative cloud gaming,” in Proceedings of IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom), Singapore, Dec. 15-18, 2014. **Best Paper Award**.
    
*Used: Java, Latex, Matlab, Gurobi, and other research methodologies.*  


##### **Research and Development Engineer @Tsinghua University (Beijing, China)    Jul. 2011-Aug. 2013**
Web-based Manufacturing Execution System (MES): a decomposed and reconfigurable system that allows manufacturers to monitor and analyze the performance and the efficiency of the entire manufacturing process in real-time.

* Implemented features using data processing and data presentation techniques;
* Implemented the initial phase of an Android client to provide a remote method for on-site quality control, which is aimed to increase the manufacturing efficiency by means of process automation; Reconfigured the system into a Spring MVC-based RESTful Web service (designed and implemented RESTful API), which is then consumed by the Android client;
* Prepared technical requirement documents based on information gathered from customers and industry; involved in post-delivery support.

*Used: Java EE (Spring, JSF), Jboss, Hibernate, Lucene, MongoDB, XHTML/CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, REST.*  

## Languages and Technologies

* **Technical Languages**: Java, SQL, HTML5/XHTML, JavaScript/JQuery, C++ and VHDL;
* **APIs**: REST, Java REST client API for Android, PrimeFaces, JFreeChart, Lucene, and MongoDB, JQuery UI, Stripe;
* **Framework**: Spring, Grails, AngularJS;
* **Tools**: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, SVN, Github, and JIRA;
